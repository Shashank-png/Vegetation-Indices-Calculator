# Vegetation-Indices-Calculator
The vegetation indices calculator is a simple desktop based interface for calculation of normalized vegetation indics such as "NDVI","SAVI","EVI","NDWI","NDBI" and "NDSI". 
The interface uses features from the following modules: os, time, arcpy,arcpy.sa, arcgisscripting, Tkinter and ttk.
The interface asks for a directory to select the images from. 
Generally the images are satellite imageries form Landsat satellites. 
The Indices calculator are then designed to use the remotely sensed values to compute and present the different indices.
